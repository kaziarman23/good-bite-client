          Together, We Can End Food Waste & Feed Our People
        </p>
        <p className="mr-5">
          Join a community-driven movement to reduce food waste, share surplus
          meals, and ensure that no plate goes empty. Our platform connects
          local individuals, businesses, and organizations to redistribute
          excess food, empowering everyone to contribute to a sustainable,
          hunger-free future. Whether you have extra produce from your garden,
          surplus stock from your business, or simply want to help, there&#39;s
          a place for you here. Letâ€™s build a stronger, greener community by
          sharing what we have, one meal at a time. Save Food. Share Love.
          Strengthen Communities.
